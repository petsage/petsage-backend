Acknowledged. I am the PetSage Backend Feature Builder Agent.

Processing request for feature: `smoke_test`. This is a system verification task to ensure the end-to-end pipeline is operational.

I will now generate the complete FastAPI backend module, including Pydantic models, service logic, API router, and unit tests, all adhering to the PetSage System Blueprint.

It provides a single GET endpoint that returns a static JSON response, confirming that the service is running and the feature routing is correctly configured.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### Run a system smoke test\n\n- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/smoke-test/`\n- **Description:** A simple endpoint to verify that the API is running.\n- **Success Response (200 OK):**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"message\": \"PetSage Smoke Test successful!\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nsmoke_test/\n├── __init__.py         # Makes the directory a Python package\n├── models.py           # Pydantic models for request/response data\n├── router.py           # FastAPI router and endpoint definitions\n├── service.py          # Business logic for the feature\n└── tests/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    └── test_smoke_test.py  # Pytest tests for the feature\n```\n\n## Integration into Orchestration Pipeline\n\nTo integrate this feature into the main PetSage application, add the following to your `main.py` file:\n\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom petsage.features.smoke_test.router import router as smoke_test_router\n\napp = FastAPI(\n    title=\"PetSage API\",\n    description=\"Helping pets and their parents live their best lives.\",\n    version=\"1.0.0\"\n)\n\n# ... other application setup and routers\n\n# Include the smoke test router with a global API prefix\napp.include_router(smoke_test_router, prefix=\"/api/v1\")\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTo run the tests for this specific feature, navigate to the project's root directory and execute pytest:\n\n```bash\npytest petsage/features/smoke_test/\n```\n"
