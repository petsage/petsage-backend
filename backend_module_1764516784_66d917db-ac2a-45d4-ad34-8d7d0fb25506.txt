STATUS: `Processing`

MESSAGE: `Acknowledged. Feature request for 'smoke_test' received. This is a crucial step to validate our end-to-end pipeline. I'm fetching the blueprints and getting my paws dirty. Stand by for the complete module generation.`

STATUS: `Designing`

MESSAGE: `Design phase initiated for 'smoke_test'.
- **Pydantic Models**: Creating a simple `SmokeTestResponse` model to ensure data serialization is working correctly. No request model is needed for a simple GET endpoint.
- **API Endpoint**: Defining a GET endpoint at `/smoke_test/`. It will be a clean, straightforward check.
- **Service Logic**: The service layer will contain a single function to generate a "pawsitive" success message. This separates logic from the routing layer as per the PetSage System Blueprint.
- **Testing**: A unit test will be crafted using `TestClient` to validate the endpoint's status code and response payload.
- **Documentation**: All components will be fully documented with pet-themed docstrings and comments.
Design is looking sharp. Moving to generation.`

STATUS: `Generating`

MESSAGE: `Code generation is in progress. Building file structure, populating modules with FastAPI and Pydantic code, and writing the corresponding Pytest cases. The code will be clean, efficient, and ready for integration.`

STATUS: `Complete`

MESSAGE: `The 'smoke_test' feature has been successfully built! All files, tests, and integration instructions are packaged below. This module is ready for deployment into the PetSage ecosystem.`
