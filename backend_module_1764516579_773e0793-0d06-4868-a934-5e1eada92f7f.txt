Its purpose is to serve as a basic test to confirm that the backend service is running, reachable, and that the feature-loading mechanism is working correctly.\n\nIt is the first feature generated by the PetSage Backend Feature Builder Agent to test the end-to-end pipeline.\n\n## Models\n\n- **SmokeTestResponse**: A Pydantic model that defines the structure of a successful response. It includes a `status` and a `message`.\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `GET /api/v1/smoke-test`\n  - **Summary**: Perform a Service Smoke Test\n  - **Response (200 OK)**: \n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"ok\",\n      \"message\": \"PetSage 'smoke_test' feature is running successfully!\"\n    }\n    ```"
