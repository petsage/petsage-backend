Acknowledged. Processing feature request `smoke_test`.

As the PetSage Backend Feature Builder Agent, I will now construct the complete backend module for the `smoke_test` feature. This module will adhere to the PetSage System Blueprint, ensuring modularity, testability, and clear documentation.

The purpose of this feature is to provide a simple health check endpoint to confirm that the PetSage API is operational.

### 1. File Structure

Here is the complete file and directory structure for the new `smoke_test` feature:

### 2. Pydantic Models

This file defines the data structures for the feature's requests and responses, ensuring type safety and clear API contracts.

**File:** `src/features/smoke_test/models.py`
```python
"""
Pydantic Models for the Smoke Test Feature.

This module defines the data structures used for API responses
in the smoke_test feature.
"""

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SmokeTestResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    Defines the response structure for a successful smoke test.
    """
    status: str = Field(
        ...,
        example="ok",
        description="Indicates the operational status of the system."
    )
    message: str = Field(
        ...,
        example="PetSage system is alive and well!",
        description="A human-readable message confirming system health."
    )

def run_smoke_test() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Performs the system health check.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the system status and a confirmation message.
    """
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "PetSage system is alive and well!"
    }
```

### 4. API Router

This file defines the API endpoints, handling HTTP requests and responses. It connects the web layer to the service layer.

**File:** `src/features/smoke_test/router.py`
```python
"""
API Router for the Smoke Test Feature.

This module defines the endpoint for checking the system's health.
"""

from fastapi import APIRouter

from .models import SmokeTestResponse
from .service import run_smoke_test

# Create a new router for the smoke test feature
# This helps in modularizing the application
router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/smoke-test",
    tags=["System Health"]
)

@router.get(
    "/",
    response_model=SmokeTestResponse,
    summary="Check System Health",
    description="A simple endpoint to verify that the PetSage API is running and accessible."
)
async def check_system_health():
    """
    Handles the incoming request for a system health check.

    Calls the service layer to get the status and returns it.
    This endpoint is crucial for monitoring, uptime checks, and ensuring
    the service is operational after a deployment.

### 6. Unit Tests

Robust tests are essential for ensuring feature reliability and preventing regressions. This test validates the smoke test endpoint.

**File:** `src/features/smoke_test/tests/test_smoke_test.py`
```python
"""
Unit tests for the Smoke Test feature endpoint.
"""
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from src.main import app  # Assuming your main app instance is here

client = TestClient(app)

def test_smoke_test_success():
    """
    Tests the GET /smoke-test/ endpoint for a successful response.
    """
    # Arrange: The API endpoint path
    # Assuming a global prefix of /api/v1 is set in main.py
    endpoint_url = "/api/v1/smoke-test/"

    # Act: Make a request to the endpoint
    response = client.get(endpoint_url)

    # Assert: Check the response
    assert response.status_code == 200
    response_data = response.json()
    assert response_data["status"] == "ok"
    assert "PetSage system is alive and well!" in response_data["message"]

def test_smoke_test_openapi_schema():
    """
    Tests that the endpoint is correctly included in the OpenAPI schema.
    """
    response = client.get("/openapi.json")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    schema = response.json()
    paths = schema.get("paths", {})
    # Check if the endpoint path is in the generated documentation
    assert "/api/v1/smoke-test/" in paths
    # Check if the correct tag is applied
    assert "System Health" in schema.get("tags", [{}])[0].get("name")
```

### 7. Documentation

Clear documentation is vital for developers who will use or maintain this feature.

**File:** `src/features/smoke_test/documentation.md`
```markdown
# Feature: Smoke Test

## 1. Overview

The Smoke Test feature provides a fundamental health check endpoint for the PetSage backend system. Its primary purpose is to offer a simple, lightweight way to verify that the API server is running, accessible, and capable of processing basic requests.

This is commonly used for:
-   **Automated Monitoring:** Uptime-checking services can ping this endpoint to ensure the service is online.
-   **Deployment Verification:** After a new deployment, this endpoint can be checked to confirm the new instance is healthy.
-   **Load Balancer Health Checks:** Cloud load balancers can use this endpoint to determine if traffic should be routed to a specific server instance.

---

## 2. API Endpoints

### GET `/api/v1/smoke-test/`

-   **Description:** Checks the operational status of the API.
-   **Request Body:** None
-   **Success Response:**
    -   **Code:** `200 OK`
    -   **Content:** A JSON object confirming the system is alive.
        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok",
          "message": "PetSage system is alive and well!"
        }
        ```
-   **Error Response:** None expected under normal operation. If the service is down, it will not respond.

---

## 3. Pydantic Models

### `SmokeTestResponse`

This model defines the structure of the JSON object returned by the endpoint.

| Field     | Type   | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `status`  | string | A machine-readable status indicator. Always `"ok"`.    |
| `message` | string | A human-readable confirmation message.                 |

---

## 4. Usage Example

You can test this endpoint using `curl` from your terminal:

```sh
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/smoke-test/" -H "accept: application/json"
```

Expected output:
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"PetSage system is alive and well!"}
```
```

### 8. Integration into Orchestration Pipeline

To activate this new feature, its router must be included in the main FastAPI application instance.

**File:** `src/main.py` (Instructions for modification)

```python
# src/main.py
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

# --- PetSage System Blueprint: Feature Imports ---
# Add the new smoke_test router to the list of feature imports
from features.smoke_test.router import router as smoke_test_router
# from features.pet_profiles.router import router as pet_profiles_router # Example
# from features.user_auth.router import router as user_auth_router       # Example

# --- Lifespan Events ---
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup logic: e.g., connect to database
    print("PetSage API starting up...")
    yield
    # Shutdown logic: e.g., close database connections
    print("PetSage API shutting down...")

# --- Main App Instance ---
app = FastAPI(
    title="PetSage API",
    description="The official backend API for the PetSage application.",
    version="1.0.0",
    lifespan=lifespan
)

# --- PetSage System Blueprint: Router Integration ---
# Define a global prefix for this version of the API
API_V1_PREFIX = "/api/v1"

# Include the new smoke_test router
app.include_router(smoke_test_router, prefix=API_V1_PREFIX)
# app.include_router(pet_profiles_router, prefix=API_V1_PREFIX) # Example
# app.include_router(user_auth_router, prefix=API_V1_PREFIX)    # Example

# --- Root Endpoint ---
@app.get("/", tags=["Root"])
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the PetSage API!"}

# --- Main Execution ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

```
**Integration Complete.** The `smoke_test` feature has been successfully built and is ready for deployment. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and testing, following all PetSage guidelines.
