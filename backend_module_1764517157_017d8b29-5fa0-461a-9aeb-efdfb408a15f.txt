`STATUS: ACKNOWLEDGED`
`AGENT: PetSage Backend Feature Builder Agent`
`ACTION: Processing Payload`

Decoding message data: `{"feature":"smoke_test","description":"verify logs","requirements":"none"}`.

Request acknowledged. Initiating build for new feature module: **Smoke Test**.
This feature will serve as a basic health check endpoint for the PetSage backend, confirming that the service is running and that the logging mechanism is operational.

`STATUS: DESIGNING`
`ACTION: Generating Pydantic Models, Service Logic, and API Routes`

Designing a simple, read-only GET endpoint. No database interaction or complex business logic is required. The primary function is to log a confirmation message and return a static success response. This adheres to the principle of a minimal, reliable health check.

`STATUS: BUILDING`
`ACTION: Generating Files and Documentation`

The full module, including file structure, code, tests, and documentation, has been generated according to the PetSage System Blueprint.

`STATUS: COMPLETE`
`OUTPUT: Feature Module Package`

Its purpose is to offer a simple, reliable way to verify that the application is running and that the core logging system is functional.\n\nWhen a `GET` request is made to this endpoint, the service logs a confirmation message and returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON payload indicating the system is healthy.\n\n## API Endpoint\n\n**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health/smoke-test`\n\n**Description:** Performs a basic system smoke test.\n\n**Success Response:**\n- **Code:** `200 OK`\n- **Content:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"message\": \"PetSage backend is healthy and logging.\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Usage Example (cURL):**\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/smoke-test\n```\n"
